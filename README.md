# Recommendation-System-for-Object-Detection-and-Navigation-for-Visually-Impaired-Individuals
In this Capstone Project, we propose and prototype a portable navigation system for visually impaired individuals, combining camera-based vision and simulated LiDAR sensing to detect environmental obstacles and provide real-time guidance.
